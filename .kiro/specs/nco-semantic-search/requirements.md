# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-enabled Semantic Search for National Classification of Occupation (NCO) MVP is designed to provide a core semantic search solution that replaces keyword-based occupation code lookup. This minimum viable product will demonstrate the feasibility of semantic search for NCO-2015 data and provide essential functionality for survey enumerators and employment officers to find relevant occupation codes using natural language input.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a survey enumerator, I want to input a job description in natural language and receive semantically relevant occupation codes, so that I can accurately classify occupations without needing extensive knowledge of the NCO taxonomy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a free-text job description THEN the system SHALL return the top 5 matching occupation codes with semantic relevance ranking
2. WHEN a user enters a job title like "Sewing Machine Operator" THEN the system SHALL return relevant codes even if the exact phrase doesn't exist in the database
3. WHEN the system processes a query THEN it SHALL provide confidence scores for each returned occupation code
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show the complete 8-digit hierarchical code structure and description for each match

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear and organized search results with occupation details, so that I can easily identify and select the most appropriate occupation code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show occupation code, title, and description for each result
2. WHEN results are ranked THEN the system SHALL display them in order of semantic relevance with confidence scores
3. WHEN a user views results THEN the system SHALL highlight the hierarchical structure (division, group, sub-group, unit group)
4. IF no results meet the confidence threshold THEN the system SHALL display a "no matches found" message with suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a simple and intuitive web interface, so that I can quickly search for occupation codes without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the system THEN it SHALL provide a clean search interface with a text input field and search button
2. WHEN a user enters a query THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback during processing
3. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL display them in a clear, readable format
4. WHEN a user selects an occupation code THEN the system SHALL provide an easy way to copy or use the selected code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to load and index NCO-2015 data, so that the semantic search functionality can operate on the complete occupation classification dataset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL load NCO-2015 data from a structured format (JSON/CSV)
2. WHEN data is loaded THEN the system SHALL create semantic embeddings for all occupation descriptions
3. WHEN embeddings are created THEN the system SHALL index them for fast retrieval during search operations
4. IF data loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to implement state-of-the-art NLP models with multilingual support, so that the system can handle diverse Indian languages and provide superior semantic understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load domain-adapted BERT models fine-tuned for occupational taxonomy
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL support Hindi, English, and at least 3 regional languages (Tamil, Bengali, Marathi)
3. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use hybrid search combining dense and sparse retrieval methods
4. WHEN indexing data THEN the system SHALL implement advanced vector similarity with approximate nearest neighbor search optimization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a field enumerator, I want to use voice input and receive intelligent suggestions, so that I can work efficiently even in challenging field conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the interface THEN it SHALL provide both text and voice input options with real-time speech-to-text
2. WHEN entering queries THEN the system SHALL offer smart auto-suggestions and query refinement
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide progressive disclosure with expandable occupation hierarchies
4. WHEN users interact THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and allow result rating for continuous improvement

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want intelligent error handling and contextual help, so that I can successfully find occupation codes even with incomplete or unclear queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries have low confidence THEN the system SHALL provide "did you mean" suggestions with synonyms
2. WHEN no exact matches exist THEN the system SHALL offer semantically related occupations with explanations
3. WHEN users need help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual guidance and example queries
4. WHEN results are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL offer filtering by sector, skill level, or occupation type

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a visually impaired survey enumerator, I want full screen reader support and keyboard navigation, so that I can perform my job independently and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using assistive technology THEN the system SHALL be fully compatible with screen readers and provide ARIA labels
2. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL support complete keyboard-only operation with logical tab ordering
3. WHEN viewing content THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with 4.5:1 contrast ratios
4. WHEN interacting THEN the system SHALL provide text alternatives for all visual elements and audio feedback options
5. WHEN customizing THEN users SHALL be able to adjust font sizes, contrast, and enable high-contrast mode

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a new survey enumerator, I want an interactive learning mode and visual occupation mapping, so that I can quickly understand the NCO taxonomy and improve my classification accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning THEN the system SHALL provide an interactive NCO taxonomy explorer with visual hierarchy mapping
2. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL display "occupation neighborhoods" showing related roles and career pathways
3. WHEN using repeatedly THEN the system SHALL learn user patterns and provide personalized quick-access shortcuts
4. WHEN training THEN the system SHALL offer a gamified practice mode with accuracy scoring and progress tracking
5. WHEN collaborating THEN the system SHALL allow team sharing of frequently used codes and custom synonym banks

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive usage analytics and AI performance insights, so that I can continuously improve the system and track user adoption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboards showing search patterns, accuracy metrics, and user engagement
2. WHEN analyzing THEN the system SHALL track semantic search performance and identify areas for model improvement
3. WHEN reporting THEN the system SHALL generate automated insights about occupation trends and classification challenges
4. WHEN auditing THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs of all searches, selections, and manual overrides for compliance

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust API integration and enterprise-grade performance, so that the system can scale across MoSPI's survey operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful APIs for seamless integration with existing MoSPI applications
2. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent users with sub-second response times
3. WHEN operating THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime with automated failover and recovery
4. WHEN updating THEN the system SHALL support hot-swapping of AI models without service interruption
